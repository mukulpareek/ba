    "## Predictions\n",
    "In common parlance, prediction means to forecast a future event.  In data science, prediction means to estimate an unknown value, which could be in the future, but also in the present or the past.  The unknown value could be a number, or a category (eg, sheep, elephant, or cat).\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive modeling is different from descriptive modeling.  The primary purpose of descriptive modeling is not to predict something but instead to gain insight into the underlying phenomenon or process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A descriptive model would be judged on its intelligibility, its ability to explain the causal relationships of the data, etc (eg, why do customers leave?).  Descriptive models would use descriptive statistics such as mean, median, variance, correlations etc that we covered in the first chapter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive models are judged on the basis of their predictive power (eg, which customers will leave?).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Predictive Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive modeling involves predicting a variable of interest relating to an observation, based upon other attributes we know about that observation.  One approach to doing so is to start by specifying the structure of the model with certain numeric parameters left unspecified.  These ‘unspecified parameters’ are then calculated in a way as to fit the available data as closely as possible.  This general approach is called _parametric modeling_, as we learn the parameters of the model from the training data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are other approaches as well, for example with decision trees we find ever more ‘pure’ subsets by partitioning data based on the independent variables.  These approaches are called non-parametric modeling.  \n",

    "## What is a model?\n",
    "A model is a representation or simplified version of a concept, phenomenon, relationship, or system of the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models:  \n",
    " - help understanding by simplifying complexity  \n",
    " - aid in decision making by simulating 'what if' scenarios  \n",
    " - explain, control, and predict events on the basis of past observations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For analytics, models are mathematical representations of relationships that allow us to study, predict and profit from those relationships.  A model ultimately represents a formula for estimating the unknown value of interest.  Fitting a model is akin to identifying the relationship, or the pattern of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maching Learning  \n",
    "Machine Learning: A machine-learning system is trained rather than explicitly programmed. It’s presented with many examples relevant to a task, and it finds statistical structure in these examples that eventually allows the system to come up with rules for automating the task.\n",

    "## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform predictive analytics, we are trying to solve one of the following three types of problems: regression, classification, or clustering.  The first two fall under the umbrella of _supervised learning_, because the machine learns from examples we provide it.  The last one, clustering, is called _unsupervised learning_ because the machine figures out groups of mathematically similar items without requiring examples.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Supervised Learning – learn from examples\n",
    "       1. **Regression**: Estimate a numerical value for a continuous variable\n",
    "            - Example: estimate property values\n",
    "       2. **Classification**: Identify a category to which an observation belongs\n",
    "            - Example: predict whether a customer would respond to an offer or not\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Unsupervised Learning – identify patterns in data without examples  \n",
    "       3. **Clustering**: Group similar items together  \n",

    "## Training and Test Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "When given data, we would normally not give our algorithm access to the entire data set to learn from it.  That would be highly unusual.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we would ‘hide’ a part of the data, and use this as the ‘test’ data set to check how well our model generalizes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because models being greedy in their optimization will memorize the data they see, and fail to work outside the examples they have seen.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data used to train our model is called the **training set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once trained, we evaluate our model on the **test set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, in data rich situations, the test data set is further split into two:  \n",
    "\n",
    " - The validation set: We use this to identify the best performing model, tune hyperparameters for neural nets.  As we do this, information from the validation set is ‘leaking’ to the model as it is being optimized a little for the validation set too.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The test set: This is the final data set which stays completely unseen from the model, and used to calculate accuracy, standard errors etc.         \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**_A word from the experts [from the book ‘Elements of Statistical Learning’]_**:\n",
    "\n",
    " - If we are in a data-rich situation, the best approach for both problems is to randomly divide the dataset into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. \n",
    "    - The training set is used to fit the models; \n",
    "    - the validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection; the test set is used for assessment of the generalization error of the final chosen model. \n",
    "    - Ideally, the test set should be kept in a \"vault\", and be brought out only at the end of the data analysis. \n",
    " - Suppose instead that we use the test-set repeatedly, choosing the model with smallest test-set error. Then the test set error of the final chosen model will underestimate the true test error, sometimes substantially. \n",
    " - It is difficult to give a general rule on how to choose the number of observations in each of the three parts, as this depends on the signal-to-noise ratio in the data and the training sample size. A typical split might be 50% for training, and 25% each for validation and testing\n",

    "## Objective Functions  \n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms optimize parameters by focusing on an objective function, which is often called the ‘loss function’, or the ‘cost function’.  Sometimes, _loss function_ is a term that is applied to a single observation, and _cost function_ is used for the entire dataset (Source: Andrew Ng).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you may hear the terms loss function, cost function and objective functions used interchangeably.  All of these are the mathematical expression of the goal we are trying to optimize for.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What we do with any kind of objective function is generally try to minimize it. (Maximizing can be accommodated by putting a minus sign in front of the function and minimizing.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimization is easier if the function is continuous and differentiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For OLS regression, we minimize the $Loss Function = (y - \\hat{y})^2$  \n",
    "\n",
    "- For logistic regression binary classification, a loss function often used is the log-loss function:\n",
    "$ -(y.log(\\hat{y}) + (1-y)log(1-\\hat{y}))$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, $log(1) = 0$  \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{y}$ is the prediction, and $y$ is the observed actual value.  "

    "## Distance Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "A very fundamental concept when trying to identify patterns across data points is the ability to measure how similar or dissimilar data points are.  This is done using the concept of _distance_ - the more dissimilar things are, the farther away they are from each other and their distance is greater, and the more similar they are, the closer the distance between them will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question then is - how do you measure distance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance calculations come into play in several algorithms, particularly those that leverage the idea of finding ‘nearest neighbors’.  An observation is described by its features X.  If there are two observations, for example consider two diamonds below with their features described as below, what is the distance between the two?"

    "- For class predictions, predictive models will often (but not always) output probabilities of belonging to a particular class.  \n",
    "- For example, logistic regression will provide the probabilities of belonging to a particular class, but not a firm decision.  Consider the output from a logistic regression model, you can see the probabilities of belong to a class.  \n",
    "- In such situations, the analyst has to decide what cut-off to use for deciding class membership.  \n",
    "- Generally the default is set at 50%, ie if the prob is greater than 50%, the observation belongs to a class, otherwise not.  \n",
    "- In multi-category classification problems, the default rule is to assign to the class with the highest probability.  \n",
    "- As we discussed earlier, the costs of FPs and FNs may be asymmetrical, and we may wish to adjust the threshold manually to obtain the right mix between FPs and FNs.  \n",
    "- For example, we may want to increase TP rate (thereby reducing false negatives), even if it means increasing the FP rate.  \n",
    "- The ROC curve is a visualization of the FP rate and the TP rate at different thresholds.  Essentially, it is a plot of the table below.  \n",
